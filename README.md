# Average-Speed-Calculator
1. The safeOpen() function takes a filename as input and attempts to open the file using the open() function. If the file is successfully opened, it returns the file object. However, if the file is not found (raises a FileNotFoundError), it returns None.
2. The safeFloat() function takes a value x as input and attempts to convert it to a floating-point number using the float() function. If the conversion is successful, it returns the float value. But if the conversion raises a ValueError, it returns 0.0.
3. The averageSpeed() function calculates the average speed from a file containing speed values. It prompts the user to enter a file name and then uses the safeOpen() function to open the file. If the file does not exist (returns None), it increments a counter. If the counter reaches 2, it prints a message and exits the function. If the file exists, the function initializes variables average and i to calculate the average speed. It iterates over each line in the file, splits the line into a list of speeds, and then iterates over each speed. For each speed, it uses the safeFloat() function to convert it to a float value. If the speed is less than 2.0, it continues to the next speed. Otherwise, it adds the speed to the average and increments the count i. After iterating through all the speeds, it calculates the average by dividing the sum of speeds by the count. It then prints the average speed rounded to two decimal places. Finally, it returns from the function.

In summary, the code prompts the user for a file name, opens the file, reads the speed values from the file, calculates the average of speeds greater than or equal to 2.0, and prints the result. If the file does not exist after two attempts, it displays a message and terminates the program.
